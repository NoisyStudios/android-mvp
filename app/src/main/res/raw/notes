midi wrapper from abstraction to low level synthesizer

1- what instrument is this for?
2- what pitch? (this is only if it's not a percussive instrument)
3- what velocity?

the wrapper should handle channel switching instruments, making sure to only switch instruments
which have no notes playing, etc.

there also needs to be support for pitch bend, etc. but that can come later


three things
1. enum instrument list
2. enum note list
3. wrapper/other pojo-oriented classes that handles building midi events from instrument and pitch + velocity
